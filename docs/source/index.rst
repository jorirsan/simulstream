Welcome to *simulstream* documentation
=====================================

``simulstream`` is a Python library for simultaneous/streaming speech recognition and translation.
It enables both the simulation with existing files to score systems, like in the SimulEval project,
and the possibility to run demos on a browser.

``simulstream`` provides a WebSocket server and utilities for running streaming speech processing
experiments and demos. It supports real-time transcription and translation through streaming audio
input. By streaming, we mean that the library by default assumes that the input is an unbounded
speech signal, rather than many short speech segments as in simultaneous speech processing.
The simultaneous setting can be easily addressed by pre-segmenting the audio into many small
segments and feed each segment to ``simulstream``.
